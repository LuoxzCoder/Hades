LuaMacro 1.5

Copy your token-patched copy of Lua in this directory, and run it from here, 
e.g. 'lua -lmacro tests/testtry.lua'.  Since LuaMacro effects the compilation phase only, it is
necessary to load it separately before the code you wish to compile.

http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaMacros is where the write-up currently lives.
